# Project Plan
This section provides the first approach of the project as follows:

[Communication](#communication-plan) | [Schedule](#schedule) | [Network Design](./network.md) | [Cloud Services](./cloud.md) | [Security](./security.md) | [Ethics](./ethics.md) | [Reflection](./reflection.md) | [Return to index](./README.md)

## Communication Plan

Ensuring effective collaboration hinges on establishing a structured communication plan:Ensuring effective collaboration hinges on establishing a structured communication plan:<br>

Frequency: We will attend updates on Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday. 
Methods: Face to face meetings are to be held on Tuesdayâ€™s in tutorials and other meeting will be conducted virtually using Google Meet app. For asynchronous communication we are going to use WhatsApp. 
 
Organizing in such a manner enables the three-way meetings to be held on a three times a week basis, enabling further progress of the clients, discussions of problems faced, and overall communication. Google Meet is used in real-time communication as and when needed while WhatsApp is used for casual and not so urgent communication beyond meetings.

## Schedule
The plan of tasks for each group member for the remainder of the project is:

- Week 5: <br>
  -Examine preliminary information on the needs in designing the network <br>
  -Consider the current state of the infrastructure that is being used and try to find out whether there are any problems with it.

- Week 6: <br>
 -useful information about network diagrams research <br>
 -Write specific specifics for the 1. Admin  2. Faculty  3. Students  4. Wireless  5. Services  6. Future Expansion network configurations. <br> 
 -Identify the neswork equipment needed and the appropriate tecnology vendors. 
  
- Week 7: <br>
   - Finalise the Network diagrams of 1. Admin  2. Faculty  3. Students  4. Wireless  5. Services  6. Future Expansion<br>
     
- Week 8: <br>
  -Close the cybersecurity plan and include it as a part of the network architecture and <br>
  -Examine the options in cloud services as far as backup arrangement, application commitment, and storing of data are concerned.
  
- Week 9: 
  -Talk about how the application of cybersecurity measures impact on the convenience of the user or the flow of network traffic. <br>
  -They should ensure they have compiled all the network design documentation and forward them to the owner for their seal.
  
- Week 10: <br>
  -Review the documents that were created as part of the network design process one final time. <br> 
  -Provide the answer to any further questions or concerns.
  
- Week 11: Submit the project
